Templates
=========

django-magazine is designed to be as easy as possible to style with
CSS, or by overriding templates. All templates live in ``magazine/``.

The base template is ``magazine/magazine_base.html`` - a default ships
with the app, but you probably want to override it to apply your
styling. All other templates extend ``magazine/magazine_base.html``.

To see what other templates are overridable, take a look at the
templates_ directory.
